      <h3> What Is HTML?</h3>
      <p class="blog_txt"> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which can be a confusing term for many beginners. The best way to explain HTML is to examine the meaning of each word.

        HyperText refers to text that contains links to other texts. Every time you click on a highlighted or underlined link that takes you to another page, you are using hypertext. As more and more pages use hypertext to link to each other, a “web”
        of pages starts to form. This is where we get the term World Wide Web.

        Markup refers to the special symbols or codes that are inserted into a document to tell the web browser how to display the document data. For example, markup code may tell the browser to display a phrase in bold or italic text, or may tell
        the browser which parts of the document are headings and which are paragraphs. HTML is just one of a number of languages that uses markup code.

        Language refers to the idea that the code is standardized. Just like regular spoken languages, there are certain rules that everyone must follow when writing HTML. This is so that all browsers can understand and interpret the code. There are
        many different programming languages, and you may have heard of some of the popular ones such as Java, Python and Ruby. Each language has its own unique set of rules, and many languages can be used in combination with HTML to create amazing
        webpages and applications.

        If we put these three definitions together, we could say that HTML is “a programming language that uses unique code which allows you to display linked documents in a browser”.
      </p>
      <h3> Why Should You Learn HTML?</h3>
      <p class="blog_txt"> These days, website builders such as Wix and SiteBuilder have made building websites easy. With a simple drag and drop interface and a variety of templates, anyone can build a website that is both functional and stylish.

        But what if you’re not interested in having a website that looks just like everyone else’s? What happens when you want to make changes to your site that go beyond what’s available using the drag and drop builder?

        With a basic knowledge of HTML (as well as a little CSS), you can build a truly unique website that you can edit and update yourself, and you won’t have to pay expensive monthly service fees.

        Learning HTML is also considered the first step for progressing into more complex and in-demand programming languages. Fancy earning a six-figure salary as a web developer for a Silicon Valley startup? Or maybe you’ve got plans to develop the
        next Facebook or Twitter? If you’re interested in learning how to do any web related programming, HTML is the place to start.

      <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
      <p class="blog_txt"> CSS is a language that defines the design and layout of web pages. In other words, CSS controls how web pages look when loaded in a browser. We call this design and layout the “style” of the page. CSS is the standard
        language for styling and typically works in conjunction with HTML (the language that defines the content of web pages).
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. “Style Sheets” refers to the CSS document itself, and “Cascading” refers to how style rules are applied to page elements. I’ll explain what that means in more detail later on, but let’s first learn what
        CSS does.
        Without CSS, the web as we know it would look nothing like it does today.HTML and CSS go hand-in-hand in building the web pages we know and love. However, these are distinct languages, and it’s important to understand their different
        purposes.

        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) determines the contents of a web page, including text, links, images, videos etc. An HTML file lists all of the “things” on a page, but it doesn’t specify how these things look when displayed in a browser.

        CSS, as we now know, controls the style of these elements. CSS ensures the HTML contents appear to users the way it was intended by designers.

        You might be wondering: Why separate these two languages? It’s a reasonable question, since HTML and CSS work together. The answer is that separating style and content makes developing websites much, much easier.

        A brief history lesson: When HTML was first introduced in the 1990s, styling was much less of a consideration — the focus was more on just presenting information on a web page. Once developers had that down, the next step was adding
        rudimentary visual embellishments like colors and fonts.

        The first implementation of HTML styling was special HTML tags and attributes that would affect how the text looked. This tacked-on solution worked, but it was far from ideal for designers, especially as websites grew. Those building large
        online properties had to apply styling to every page element within each HTML file.

        You can imagine how this would become a tad maddening. Hence, CSS was created to style HTML without having to change the HTML files directly. Since then, there have been several updates to CSS that add new capabilities — the current standard
        is CSS3.
      </p>
      <h3>Benefits of CSS </h3>
      <p class="blog_txt"> As it turns out, there are multiple benefits to separating content code from style code. These include:

        Less coding: Developers can use CSS to apply the same styling to multiple pages and page elements across a website, saving huge amounts of time and reducing the chance of errors. Modifying a site-wide style requires changing just a snippet of
        code.
        More styling options: You can do a lot with CSS, much more than was permitted by the original HTML styling system. With a clear vision, CSS know-how, and some patience, you can customize a website exactly to your preference.
        Standardization: Since CSS is the uniform language for styling web pages, a developer or designer can understand the styling for any website by looking at the CSS files.
        Better performance: CSS reduces the amount of repetitive styling code. Less code means smaller files, and smaller files mean faster page load times.

      <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
      <p class="blog_txt">
        JavaScript is a scripting language. Scripting languages do not need to undergo compilation. They rely on special run-time environments and related interpreters—computer programs that execute code without compilation through various methods.
        Modern web browsers include interpreters that can interpret Javascript code.The most popular environment you will find JavaScript outside of the browser is for NodeJS. NodeJS is a JavaScript engine that runs without a browser in a server
        environment. This means you can use JavaScript to build a complete web
        application from the backend to the frontend.

        In addition, various mobile frameworks like Cordova, Ionic, and React Native allow developers to build mobile apps using web technology, including JavaScript for any scripting.
        There are few real alternatives to JavaScript for executing code in a browser. These options offer an alternative syntax to JavaScript but are compiled to pure JavaScript before we can use them in a browser. Some popular alternatives to
        JavaScript include CoffeeScript, TypeScript, and Dart.

        When using these alternative languages, your code is translated to Javascript then executed in the browser.

        Adding JavaScript to HTML
        In the experiment above, you used the console of your web browser to execute JavaScript code. The standard use of JavaScript is to add scripting to HTML pages. To do that, you need to include JavaScript in the HTML itself. When a browser
        detects a script tag in an HTML file, it knows to execute JavaScript code. Using this tag, you can either embed your JavaScript code directly in an HTML file or include a separate JavaScript source file.
      </p>

      <h3>JavaScript basics</h3>
      <p class="blog_txt"> Before you write more JavaScript code, it pays to know the basics. Every programming language has rules, and JavaScript is no different. The rules of a programming language are like those of a spoken language, except when
        you break the
        rules in code, the most likely result is that your code will not work.

        The following features of the JavaScript language are common to most programming languages, but how they handle them are different.

        <br> JavaScript syntax <br>
        Syntax are the rules of writing the language, similar to grammar in a spoken language.

        Case sensitive
        One rule of JavaScript is that it is case-sensitive, meaning that if you create a variable of a specific case, like Car, then you must use the same case to access that variable again, and not car.

        Identifiers
        An identifier in JavaScript is the name of a variable, function, parameter, or class. These names must follow these rules:

        The first character must be a letter (a-z or A-Z), an underscore(_), or a dollar sign ($).
        The other characters can be letters (a-z or A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
        While not a rule of the JavaScript language, a convention followed by most developers is that these names should be in CamelCase. CamelCase capitalizes every word in a name except the first.
